# INTRODUCTION

• Cars of a particular make, model, year, and set of features start out with a price
set by the manufacturer. As they age and are resold as used, they are subject to
supply-and-demand pricing for their particular set of features, in addition to
their unique history.
• The more this sets them apart from comparable cars, the harder they become to
evaluate with traditional methods. Using Machine Learning algorithms to
better utilize data on all the less common features of a car can more accurately
assess the value of a vehicle.
• Due to the on-going pandemic, most people are not ready to travel long
distances mainly on public transport.
• They are preferring to travel in their vehicles and the people who cannot afford
the new cars planning to buy the used cars. And the other section people are
ready to sell their cars and planning to buy a new car
• New cars of a particular make, model, and year all have the same retail price, excluding optional 
features.
• This price is set by the manufacturer. Used car, however, are subject to supply-and-demand 
pricing. Further, used cars have additional attributes that factor into the price. 
• The used car market is generally divided into two categories, retail and wholesale. The retail price 
is the higher of the two prices and is what an individual should expect when buying a car at a 
dealership.

#Aim and Objectives

• The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate several different machine
learning models for used car price prediction and draw conclusions about
how they behave. This will deepen the knowledge of machine learning
applied to car valuations and other similar price prediction problems
• For the purposes of car valuation, popular guides tend not to use machine
learning. Instead, they source data from local sales and average the prices
of many similar cars.

#How to Run
Extract the file from zip folder and open the car file prediction file and place it in a path , open the Anaconda navigator open the environment section and create a file and open terminal
Code ( cd _file path)
(Python app.py)
